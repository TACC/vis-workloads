One of the motivating factors in the design of this benchmark suite was to characterize typical visualization workflows for researchers that use HPC resources and identify bottlenecks.  The data-set and workflow scenarios encompass astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, bioscience, computational fluid dynamics and climate modeling.  Some data-sets and visualization workflows provided much greater flexibility and scalability, making them more suitable for the comprehensive and exhaustive tests designed to stress the system components and memory loads.  The domain specific benchmarks are launched by a primary python script which will call the appropriate data specific implementation scripts to load the data, apply the requested filters, and visualization algorithms, and render an image.  The ability to programmatically vary the geometry and resulting memory footprint was critical for generating useful metrics for system components and comparisons.  Similarly, the ability to apply a number of different visualization algorithms or renderers to the same data-set makes it much easier to draw conclusions on what factors effect performance.  The results presented here are from the computational dynamics and geoscience datasets and visualization workflows that proved themselves to be the most useful for our purposes.  These data-sets provide comprehensive coverage of the visualization operations of interest and can be scaled programmatically to triangle counts from 4 to 300 million.  The benchmark suite includes automated graph generation scripts to produce formatted dat files and graphs to highlight the selected variable (e.g. renderer or vis algorithm or system type) as a function of triangle scaling, node scaling, process scaling on one node, and memory utilization.  For dynamic data scenarios, these same metrics are used as a function of frame or stage in the workflow.</p>

Turbulent Channel Flow: Wall bounded turbulent flow channel flow computed by direct numerical simulation (DNS), meaning, the fluid flow equations are solved without subgrid modeling.  Almost a quarter of global energy consumption is expended on transportation through air or water or fluid being transported through ducts, and this energy is dissipated primarily in turbulence.  This model of wall-bounded turbulence will help inform the development of new efficient designs of turbulent fluid systems.  Each geometry level has a corresponding triangle count in the millions: 69.88, 142.38, 210.33, 276.36, 343.79, 413.39, 485.66, 558.72</p>
